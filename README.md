# Git It Done
Git It Done is a frontend application that makes use of the GitHub API to allow the user to search a GitHub User, repositories centered around HTML, JavaScript, or CSS. After searching, the application will then show a list of repositories and if they have any unresolved issues. Once clicking a repository, it will bring another list of the specific issues which then can be clicked to take you directly to the link that will show that issue.

## Features
1. Users can search GitHub users.
2. Users can search for repositories specific for HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
3. Users can see how many unresolved issues there are for specific repositories.
4. Users can access the specific link to the issue they wish to view.

## User Story
As a user looking for a way to find a list of repositories with open issues, I would like an application that allows me to search a specific user or through topics such as HTML, CSS, or Javascript so that I can find any issues that I may be able to help resolve so I can practice my frontend development skills. I would like an easy way to access those issues so that I don't have to find them manually on GitHub but rather the application take me to it directly.
